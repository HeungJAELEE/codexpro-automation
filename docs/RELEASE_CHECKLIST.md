# Release checklist

Repository-backed new work uses GitHub and Codex Cloud by default. Oracle and
DevSpace are an explicit local-only lane. CodexPro and agbrowse checks below
apply only to packaging integrity and exact recovery of already-persisted
legacy runs; they are not active cloud routing prerequisites.

- Run `python scripts/validate_cloud_first.py --root .` and
  `python -m pytest -q tests/test_cloud_first_contract.py` on Linux without
  Tailscale, a browser profile, a local Bridge, or an OpenAI API key.
- Confirm the cloud job checks out the exact commit and runs on
  `ubuntu-latest`. Its success proves repository portability, not a production
  deployment or a configured Codex Cloud account environment.
- Confirm `contracts/cloud/cloud-first-v1.json`, `AGENTS.md`, both READMEs, and
  the routing manifest agree on GitHub authority, Codex Cloud default, explicit
  local-only scope, dirty-tree fail-closed behavior, and remote evidence.
- Perform the PC-off acceptance in `CLOUD_FIRST_OPERATIONS.md` for each target
  repository before claiming that repository is independent of the host.

The default installer must leave both frozen dependencies untouched.
`-InstallLegacyRecoveryDependency` is the only opt-in that may install or
contract-validate agbrowse for an old persisted run.

- Run `python scripts/check_portability.py --root .`, `python scripts/run_v4_contract_tests.py --focused`, `python scripts/run_v3_contract_tests.py`, and `python scripts/run_v4_contract_tests.py --full`.
- Confirm `install-manifest.json` and `package.json` inventory every shipped runtime/schema file, the v4 runner, and both v7/v8 quiescent app-trace incident fixtures.
- Confirm MIT copyright is `2026 ventianima-lab` and third-party notices retain the multi-gpt commit/hash attribution.
- Do not vendor agbrowse, Codex, CodexPro, browser binaries, or account data.
- Verify no workflow has `schedule`; CI must use Windows and mocked/offline lifecycle checks.
- Treat agbrowse update as an explicit, reviewed agent action. There is no background checker, scheduled updater, candidate slot, or promotion pointer.
- Exercise `install.ps1`, `doctor.ps1`, `uninstall.ps1`, and `rollback.ps1` with a temporary `CODEX_HOME`; never require Git to bootstrap or verify a release.
- Before a normal install, verify its read-only dependency preflight completes before any managed file mutation. The returned token binds selected version/integrity, prior dependency identity, and observed unlocked state; the subsequent update must reacquire the lock and reject drift. Before an explicit update, confirm no active or uncertain run state exists. The update receipt must preserve the prior npm version/integrity, executable and contract hashes, then capture and validate the reviewed public-command contract before replacing it.
- Future agbrowse versions must be explicit resolved semvers. Pass their exact registry integrity to contract capture/validation, retain 0.1.18 only as the tested baseline, and require the invoking agent/workflow to select the resulting versioned contract explicitly.
- Exercise both file-only install rollback and mocked normal install rollback. Receipt v3 must restore the prior agbrowse package, selected contract bytes, and prior update receipt; the exact inverse must prove registry integrity, installed version, and executable SHA-256 after npm reports success. Dependency drift must fail in preflight before installed files change, and any late inverse failure must report `PARTIAL`.
- Verify install WAL behavior: per file, durable `INTENT` precedes mutation; the file is flushed, `replacement.json` is written, hashes are verified, and only then is the entry `COMPLETE`. A later install resumes an interrupted WAL by restoring only receipt-owned bytes; a modified destination remains a conflict.

## Parallel implementation v3

- Confirm all eight v3 schemas parse as draft 2020-12 and retain `additionalProperties: false`, bounded IDs/paths, and registered test IDs rather than free shell strings.
- Verify a missing manifest gate or environment gate creates no lease, parent run, staging repository, exact-unit app, tunnel, or browser send.
- Exercise fixed topology, logical/final overlap, drive/home equality, reparse escape, singleton allowed roots, and sibling isolation tests.
- Verify staging uses `--no-local --no-hardlinks --no-checkout`, has no alternates/reference/shared object store, and detects worker mutation of common Git metadata.
- Verify every dependency and path-conflict edge is unioned into one component, only one unit per component is active, and independent components may continue when another component requires exact-session recovery.
- Verify `send.claim` v2 is immutable and authority-bound; post-send uncertainty must never create a second provider submission.
- Verify exact-unit app identity includes singleton roots, bash off, workspace write, full tool mode, actual listener identity, and separate Cloudflare tunnel identity immediately before send.
- Run `python scripts/run_v3_contract_tests.py`; opt into the live Windows exact-unit integration only in an isolated release environment with test credentials.
- Verify full registered tests and canonical baseline/config/submodule/filesystem revalidation occur before temporary-ref import and ff-only apply. A forced conflict or test failure must leave canonical source unchanged.

# Release lifecycle safety

- `install.ps1` only manages manifest-owned files. By default it neither
  installs nor updates CodexPro/agbrowse because those dependencies are frozen
  for new work. `-InstallLegacyRecoveryDependency` is an explicit opt-in used
  only when an existing persisted legacy run requires that exact recovery
  runtime; `-SkipDependencyInstall` suppresses dependency mutation entirely.
- Retain the unique receipt and backup directory. `uninstall.ps1` is a safe inverse: it removes only unchanged created files and restores only unchanged overwritten files; modified destinations are reported as conflicts.
- Run `doctor.ps1` before an explicit `update.ps1 -AgbrowseVersion <version>`. Updates defer while bridge state is active or uncertain and never terminate it.
