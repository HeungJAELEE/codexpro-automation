# CodexPro Automation Repository Rules

## GPT Automation Change Persistence

- Any durable change to GPT or ChatGPT skills, CodexPro/agbrowse bridges, browser runners, prompt or mode routing, recovery, state, locks, tabs, app registration, Web Multi-GPT, or their tests must include focused verification and a descriptive Git commit before the work is reported complete.
- The installed files under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex` are deployment copies, not the sole source of truth. Synchronize reusable fixes back into this repository instead of leaving them only in the global installation.
- Public-safe reusable changes must be committed to the clean public `main`, pushed, and checked in CI. Never copy credentials, host-only values, sensitive artifacts, or private Git history into this repository.
- Never push a private-history development branch to the public repository. If commit, push, or CI verification is blocked, report the exact dirty files and blocker and do not claim completion.

## Cloud-first ownership

- GitHub is the source of truth for every repository-backed task. Codex Cloud is the default execution lane, and a remote branch or pull request plus observed CI is the durable result.
- A cloud task starts from one exact GitHub branch or commit, loads the applicable `AGENTS.md` chain, runs declared tests, reviews the diff, pushes a dedicated branch, and observes CI on the exact commit before completion.
- Cloud work must not infer unpublished local bytes. A dirty local working tree must be synchronized to an explicit backup branch without secrets or machine-only artifacts, or the task must block or stay local.
- Oracle, DevSpace, CodexPro Bridge, Tailscale, signed-in desktop browsers, and local Codex lanes form an explicit local-only lane. Use it only when the user explicitly needs unpublished local files, signed-in desktop apps, or exact persisted-run recovery.
- Local Bridge, Funnel, Worker, browser, or host health is not cloud completion evidence. The cloud lane must remain usable when that host is offline.

## Explicit local-only lane ownership

- When the explicit local-only lane is selected, every new browser submission uses Oracle. Regular GPT uses the manually registered DevSpace app; Pro uses Oracle attachment-only and never selects an app.
- New GPT comprehensive workflows use `codex.chatgpt.oracle-comprehensive/v1`. Existing CodexPro/agbrowse comprehensive v1-v4 state remains exact recovery-only.
- The completing web GPT stage authors the next stage's semantic prompt. Local Codex may validate UTF-8, hashes, stage identity, immutable bindings, transport, recovery, and deterministic final tests, but must not rewrite the next prompt or take over expensive exploration/implementation.
- A selected Web Multi advisory uses genuine independent Oracle sessions. Provider generation is limited to at most five concurrent children; larger accepted topologies run in capacity waves without reducing their logical lane count.
- Comprehensive review owns plan repair and finalization. It fixes every locally resolvable defect inline, writes the corrected final plan and implementation mission, then returns PASS or PASS_WITH_NOTES. New work never loops review back to plan; legacy REVISE is terminal compatibility only, and FAIL requires a concrete external blocker.
- Every regular Oracle stage is bound to one exact project root and one exact mission path. DevSpace may retry that same root once after listing registered workspaces, but must never substitute a parent, child, similarly named, active workspace, or shell boundary workaround.
- Transport and runner recovery retain the exact workflow/stage identity. They must not create a replacement workflow or reset the semantic revision budget.
- CodexPro and agbrowse are frozen for new work. Their code may be invoked only to recover an exact persisted legacy run, never as an Oracle fallback.
- Every new Oracle run must use a throwaway copy of the manually signed-in profile and an Oracle-owned hidden window. Never share the manual-login Chrome process across concurrent projects.
- Exact-slug recovery may relaunch a bounded recovery browser from the persisted profile seed and open only the recorded conversation URL. It must never restart, resubmit, or create a replacement conversation.
- A nonzero Oracle exit after submission, including a browser response timeout, is attention-required rather than web-terminal failure. It retains exact-session ownership and allows only exact-slug live/harvest recovery.
- Exact session authority is monotonic. `terminal_observed` cannot regress to `live`; observer disagreement remains attention-required under the same project lock until a later exact terminal harvest produces fresh nonempty durable output.
